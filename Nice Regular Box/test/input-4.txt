Grim visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front
And now, instead of mounting barded steed
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
He capers nimbly in a ladies chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
. . .
Why, I in this weak piping time of peace
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity.
And therefore since I cannot prove a lover
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
